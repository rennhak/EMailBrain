EMailBrain
----------

Originally EMailBrain was intended only as a filtering (display_filter) help for mutt. This changed
into being a fully usable tool to not only filter emails and cut them similar to t-prot but also to
provide ways to cut out certain parts and rearrange certain information from mailinglist emails.
Furthermore it is capable of analysing a mail according to a email hook and to construct a possible
answer draft email.
